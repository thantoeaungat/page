PHPExif is a library which gives you easy access to the EXIF meta-data of an image or video.

PHPExif serves as a wrapper around some native or CLI tools which access this EXIF meta-data from an image video. As such, it provides a standard API for retrieving and accessing that information.

## Supported tools

* Native PHP functionality (exif_read_data, iptcparse) [images]
* [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool) adapter (wrapper for the exiftool binary) [images and videos]
* [FFmpeg/FFprobe](https://ffmpeg.org) adapter (wrapper for the exiftool binary) [videos]
* [Imagick](https://www.php.net/manual/de/book.imagick.php) adapter [images]

## Installation (composer)

```sh
composer require lychee-org/php-exif
```
